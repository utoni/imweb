# WebGui

WebGui is an example showing how to use the IMGUI user interface in a web browser.

See the [Live Demo](https://jnmaloney.github.io/WebGui/imgui.html) here.

This example uses Emscripted to compile c++ into Web Assembly (WASM) binaries that can be run as an application in the browser.

The source depends on OpenGL3, ES3, GLFW as well as Freetype and IMGui. I have attempted to make the most lightweight version of IMGUI possible to run in the browser.
